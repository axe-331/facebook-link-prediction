The challenge is to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge\r\nattribute data.\r\n\r\n# Supervised Random Walks:\r\n    This repository is the implementation of Link prediction based on the paper Supervised Random Walks by  Lars Backstrom et al. The essence of which is that we combine the information from the network structure with the node and edge level attributes using Supervised Random Walks. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
