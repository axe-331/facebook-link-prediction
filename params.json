The challenge is to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge\r\nattribute data.\r\n\r\n# Supervised Random Walks:\r\nThis repository is the implementation of Link prediction based on the paper Supervised Random Walks by  Lars Backstrom et al. The essence of which is that we combine the information from the network structure with the node and edge level attributes using Supervised Random Walks. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.\r\n\r\n# Problem Description:\r\nWe are given a directed graph _G(V,E)_, a node _s_ and a set of candidates to which _s_ could create an edge. We label nodes to which _s_ creates edges in the future as _destination nodes D = {d<sub>1</sub>,..,d<sub>k</sub>}_, while we call the other nodes to which s does not create edges no-link nodes _L = {l<sub>1</sub>,..,l<sub>n</sub>}_. We label candidate nodes with a set _C = D union L_. _D_ are positive training examples and _L_ are negative training examples. We can generalize this to multiple instances of _s, D, L_. Each node and each edge in G is further described with a set of features. We assume that each edge _(u,v)_ has a corresponding feature vector psi<sub>uv</sub> that describes u and v and the interaction attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Our Implementation:","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
