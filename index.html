        <h1>Link Prediction:</h1>

<p>We are given snapshot of a network and would like to infer which which interactions among existing
members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. The challenge is to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge
attribute data.</p>

<h1>Supervised Random Walks:</h1>

<p>This repository is the implementation of Link prediction based on the paper Supervised Random Walks by  Lars Backstrom et al. The essence of which is that we combine the information from the network structure with the node and edge level attributes using Supervised Random Walks. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.</p>

<h1>Problem Description:</h1>

<p>We are given a directed graph <em>G(V,E)</em>, a node <em>s</em> and a set of candidates to which <em>s</em> could create an edge. We label nodes to which <em>s</em> creates edges in the future as <em>destination nodes D = {d<sub>1</sub>,..,d<sub>k</sub>}</em>, while we call the other nodes to which s does not create edges no-link nodes <em>L = {l<sub>1</sub>,..,l<sub>n</sub>}</em>. We label candidate nodes with a set <em>C = D union L</em>. <em>D</em> are positive training examples and <em>L</em> are negative training examples. We can generalize this to multiple instances of <em>s, D, L</em>. Each node and each edge in G is further described with a set of features. We assume that each edge <em>(u,v)</em> has a corresponding feature vector psi<sub>uv</sub> that describes u and v and the interaction attributes.</p>
