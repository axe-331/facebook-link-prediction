        <h1>Link Prediction:</h1>

<p>We are given snapshot of a network and would like to infer which which interactions among existing
members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. The challenge is to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge
attribute data.</p>

<h1>Supervised Random Walks:</h1>

<p>This repository is the implementation of Link prediction based on the paper Supervised Random Walks by  Lars Backstrom et al. The essence of which is that we combine the information from the network structure with the node and edge level attributes using Supervised Random Walks. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.</p>

<h1>Problem Description:</h1>

<p>We are given a directed graph <em>G(V,E)</em>, a node <em>s</em> and a set of candidates to which <em>s</em> could create an edge. We label nodes to which <em>s</em> creates edges in the future as <em>destination nodes D = {d<sub>1</sub>,..,d<sub>k</sub>}</em>, while we call the other nodes to which s does not create edges no-link nodes <em>L = {l<sub>1</sub>,..,l<sub>n</sub>}</em>. We label candidate nodes with a set <em>C = D union L</em>. <em>D</em> are positive training examples and <em>L</em> are negative training examples. We can generalize this to multiple instances of <em>s, D, L</em>. Each node and each edge in G is further described with a set of features. We assume that each edge <em>(u,v)</em> has a corresponding feature vector psi<sub>uv</sub> that describes u and v and the interaction attributes.</p>

<p>For each edge (u,v) in G we compute the strength <em>a<sub>uv</sub> = f<sub>w</sub>(psi<sub>uv</sub>)</em>. Function <em>f<sub>w</sub></em> parameterized by <em>w</em> takes the edge feature vector <em>psi<sub>uv</sub></em> as input and computes the corresponding edge strength <em>a<sub>uv</sub></em> that models the random walk transition probability. It is exactly the function <em>f<sub>w</sub>(psi)</em> we learn in the training phase of the algorithm.</p>

<p>To predict new edges to <em>s</em>, first edge strengths of all edges are calculated using <em>f<sub>w</sub></em>. Then random walk with restarts is run from <em>s</em>. The stationary distribution <em>p</em> of random walk assigns each node <em>u</em> a probability <em>p<sub>u</sub></em>. Nodes are ordered by <em>p<sub>u</sub></em> and top ranked nodes are predicted as future destination nodes to <em>s</em>. The task is to learn the parameters <em>w</em> of function <em>f<sub>w</sub>(psi<sub>uv</sub>)</em> that assigns each edge a transition probability. One can think of the weights <em>a<sub>uv</sub></em> as edge strengths and the random walk is more likely to traverse edges of high strength and thus nodes connected to node <em>s</em> via paths of strong edges will likely to be visited by the random walk and will thus rank higher.</p>

<h2>The optimization problem:</h2>

<p>The training data contains information that source node <em>s</em> will create edges to node <em>d subset D</em> and not <em>l subset L</em>. So we set parameters <em>w</em> of the function <em>f<sub>w</sub>(psi<sub>uv</sub>)</em> so that it will assign edge weights <em>a<sub>uv</sub></em> in such a way that the random walk will be more likely to visit nodes in <em>D</em> than <em>L</em>, <em>i.e.,</em> <em>p<sub>l</sub> &lt; p<sub>d</sub></em> for each <em>d subset D</em> and <em>l subset L</em>. And thus we define the optimization problem as follows.
